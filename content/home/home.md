### Kind Praise

> Chaz Southard paid great attention to detail, ensuring that our unique navigational features were coded properly and troubleshooting minor problems.   Since our site launch in August of 2012, we have received numerous compliments on the layout and overall look of the site, as well as a significant increase in traffic.
- MARILYN A. SMITH, EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR | U2FP

> The process was painless as Ibis obtained the necessary information, organized it, and interacted with me in a non-threatening, inquisitive, and encouraging professional approach. I have the greatest respect for his ability and his attitude of helpfulness. I value his friendship as well as his commitment to his work and passion for excellence.
- ERIC J. RUBY, M.D., F.A.A.P. | MASSWALKSAGAIN

> Ibis Interactive tackled what was, for me, an overwhelming project by juggling immediate Web creation needs with his strong desire and ability to organize, design, and update my site. Another key success measure the ability to communicate well -- our email and phone conversations were thoughtful and thorough. I always felt -- and continue to feel -- that Chaz's enthusiasm for me and my work shines through.
- J. FREEDMAN | UNCLE J'S MONSTERS

> Ibis Interactive was very easy to work with throughout the design process. Before, during and after the project was completed C. Southard was always available to provide great customer service for us.
- ADAM KERSNOWSKI | MODEL MASONRY

> It is always a pleasure to work with C Southard on our projects. He focuses on the purpose of the project and translates that into an attractive and functional website.  Working with Ibis Interactive is a true partnership and a very rewarding experience.
